 <h2>1. The James Rodriguez:</h2>

Ive used the p tag becasue it puts the text in a paragraph format making it look more professional to the reader and easier to read rather than it being in a long line of text.-->
 <p> So-called in honour of the Columbian playmaker, this is an effective move designed to buy you some space as you head towards goal.

Here are the key steps:

Run towards goal and then fake to cut inside, making your opponent change direction;
Cut outside again, controlling the ball with the outside of your foot; and
Get your shot away.</p>
</div>
            
          <div class = "flexitem">
    <h2>2. The Cruyff Turn:</h2>


 

<p>Named after the famous Dutch footballer of the 1970s, Johann Cruyff, this manoeuvre not only allows you to open space, but it can also make your opponent look foolish.

Here is how to perform a Cruyff turn:

Receive the ball on your instep and shape as if you were passing to a teammate;
Transfer your weight to your standing foot;
Swivel your hips and change direction; and
    Speed away from your opponent.</p>

          <h2>3. Ronaldinho Elastico:</h2>


 

<p>Another move named after one of my favourite players. Ronaldinho, nicknamed the ‘magician’ is a World Cup winner and twice World Footballer of the Year.

This move is all about surprise and technique, and needs a lot of practice. Get your timing right and you’ll use this one over and over.

Dribble towards a defender, slowly, with the ball at your feet. They will hopefully come towards you.
Nudge the ball with the outside of your feet; and
In one movement switch to the instep, enabling you to skip past him.
This is not easy to do, and you may have to spend a lot of time getting used to moving the ball from the outside of your foot to the instep in one motion.

       </p>

            <h2>4. The Rainbow Flick:</h2>


 
<p>
Another tough one to perfect, but another trick which looks great when it comes off is the Rainbow Flick (also known as the Lambreta in Brazil).

The trick gets its name from the trajectory of the ball, which travels from back to front in an arc. Getting the ball positioning is key to this trick.

Place one foot in front of the ball with your body slightly angled towards your opponent;
Then with the back foot roll it up your calf, leaning even more towards your opponent; and.
Finally, jump and flick the ball over your head in the direction in which you are leaning.
       </p>

                <h2>5. The Griezmann:</h2>


 
<p>
Although by no means exclusive to the French World Cup winner and Barcelona forward, this turn and trick has still become synonymous with him.

Again this move is all about close control and balance.

As you approach a defender stand on the ball and tap it forward with the weak foot;
As your opponent lunges for the ball, take advantage of the fact that he is off balance; and
Knock it past him with your stronger foot, and move away from him.

       </p>

         <h2>6. The Maradona Turn:</h2>



 <p>

When we talk of the world’s best football skills, you also think of the world’s best footballers who made them possible. With that in mind, we can’t leave out the little Argentinian maestro, Diego Maradona.

The Maradona turn is all about close control, the ability to turn in a complete circle and bamboozling your opponent whilst using both feet.

Start off by placing the sole of your left foot on the ball
Drag it back whilst pivoting your body
Release your left foot of the ball and as you complete the half turn, allow your right foot to take over
Using your right foot, drag the ball out in front of you so you can continue dribbling
       </p>
 
 

   
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            </div>
          
        

          


        
          </div>

               <h2>7. The Chop:</h2>


 
<p>
This is a move which is best done at high speed because it will help send your opponent the wrong way. It’s all about shifting the ball from one side of of your body to the other side.

Run towards the defender;
As they draw near, jump up and land by chopping the ball under your standing leg
Break away into space with a quick change of pace
When this is done right, you and the ball will go one way, whilst your opponent is still going the other!

       </p>

              <h2>8. The Neymar Rollover Rabona:</h2>


 
<p>
This one can be difficult to pull off in a game but if you manage to do so, you’ll probably end up nutmegging your opponent leaving them with their head in the ground trying to hide from embarrassment.

This is why the Neymar Rollover Rabona is one of the contenders for the best football skills to learn.

Put your right foot on top of the ball;
Roll it across your body to the opposite side;
Step over it with your left foot;
Immediately after your step over the ball, use your right foot to tap the ball forward with the laces
       </p>

          <div class = "flexitem-r3">
            
            
            
           <h2>9. The Step-Over Snapback:</h2> 


 
<p>
This trick makes it in our list as one of the best football skills to practice because it’s very simple but effective in opening space. It can be done either standing skill or on the run.

With the ball at your feet, lean forward with your weight;
Using the same foot, roll the ball across your body using the sole of your foot whilst you perform a step over.
Now use the opposite foot to snap the ball back in the opposite direction, transferring your weight accordingly.
The key to his move is in the name. It is all about the explosiveness of the move and taking your opponent by surprise.
       </p>

<h2>10. The Fake Rabona:</h2>


 <p>

As a coach, this is one of the best football skills to teach. Kids love it and they love attempting it in the games.

The Fake Rabona means pretending to kick the ball from behind your standing foot. Here are the steps

Dribble ahead with your body facing forward
Pretend to perform the Rabona and as you do, bring your left foot in front of the ball
Now use your right foot to sneak behind and take over by changing the direction of the ball using the laces
At the same time, you’ll have to swivel your body round so you can take off in the opposite direction
