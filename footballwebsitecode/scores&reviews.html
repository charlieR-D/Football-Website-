    <p>Raheem Sterling’s first major tournament goal fired England to a 1-0 victory over Croatia at Wembley in their UEFA EURO 2020 opener. 

The Manchester City winger put England in front just before the hour mark after fine work from Kalvin Phillips as they won their opening game in a European Championships for the first time to go top of Group D. 

England enjoyed the better of the opening passages but had to wait until the second half to break the deadlock against the side who knocked them out of the 2018 World Cup at the semi-final stage. 

Gareth Southgate had made the decision to play Kieran Trippier at left-back, while Declan Rice and Phillips set up as a midfield two to protect the England defence.  Sterling was selected on the left and he threatened early and often for England, before breaking his major tournament duck in the second half. 

England started very strongly, with Phil Foden hitting the inside of the post after just five minutes after cutting inside from the right. 

 
        </p>
        
        <p>
The hosts were piling on the pressure as their high press starved Croatia and, particularly skipper Luka Modric, of time on the ball. That allowed England to dominate possession and territory, with the first ten minutes proving particularly fruitful. 

Sterling and Foden combined on the counter, with the younger Manchester City man opening up his body and curling the ball with his left foot. It took a slight deflection of Josko Gvardiol, and that was enough to push it onto the inside of the post and away with Dominik Livakovic beaten. 

Shortly after, it was Sterling and Mason Mount who produced some nice interplay to put Sterling into space in the box, Duje Caleta-Car getting back this time but conceding the corner. 

From that set-piece, Phillips reacted quickly when a ball came out to the edge of the box and Livakovic had to get down sharply to parry away his fizzing shot. 

Croatia had found themselves on the back foot, but after struggling to find their feet in the first 20 minutes, they were able to push forwards thereafter as the pace of the game dropped in the heat. </p>
        
        <p>
Right-back Sime Vrsaljko was proving dangerous, with Tyrone Mings having to be alert to head clear a cross from the Atletico Madrid man. 

Croatia continued to channel their attacks down the right, while Modric’s influence grew as the game went on. 

And yet it was England who had the last chance of the half. It came after Caleta-Car had handled the ball as Sterling was fastest to a long ball through. He was yellow-carded and Trippier attempted to the repeat the trick of the World Cup semi-final three years ago, but his free-kick from the edge of the box could not quite clear the head of Ivan Perisic in the wall. 

Croatia looked comfortable after the break, with Modric trying his luck from distance but Jordan Pickford dealt with it comfortably. 

And just before the hour England finally found a way through the Croatia defence. Sterling had just been denied on a through-ball but second time around he made no mistake. Kyle Walker slid the ball through to Phillips who cut inside one man and then put the through-ball to Sterling who fired past Livakovic with a first-time strike on his right.</p>

    <p>

Liverpool delivered an annihilation job on Manchester United on Sunday evening, battering the hosts 5-0 at Old Trafford in a game that saw pressure mount further on under-fire manager Ole Gunnar Solsjkaer.
The Norwegian could only watch on dismayed as the Merseyside side carved his Red Devils to shreds, and a hat-trick from Mohamed Salah provided the prime highlight of an incredible game of football, for one side at least.
Jurgen Klopp's side arrived with attacking intent; and they were one up within five minutes, Salah turning provider for Naby Keita to slide beyond a hapless David de Gea.
        
        </p>
        
        <!--        Ive used p tags here because i wanted the text to be in a paragraph format and rather than the text be seperate, be together in a paragraph so it looks professional like an article -->
        
    <p>It would go from bad to worse eight minutes later; a defensive miscommunication between compatriots Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire paved the way for Keita to feed Trent Alexander-Arnold, who found the returning Diogo Jota sliding in at the back stick to double Liverpool's cushion.
Salah notched the first for his own tally on 38 minutes, with Klopp's men slicing the hosts apart: Roberto Firmino, Jota, Keita sliding it across, and the Egyptian beat Victor Lindelof to the cross at the near post for 3-0.
        
        
        He then doubled his winnings on the stroke of half time; kamikaze United defending from a harmful Liverpool throw, with Lindelof, Maguire and Shaw all sucked in by the ball, and Firmino turned the tight-marking United captain and fed his talismanic right winger, who did the rest. Four.
Cristiano Ronaldo was fortunate not to be sent off for kicking out at substitute Curtis Jones before the break, and United's poor discipline would be a recurring theme later on in the match, with Paul Pogba himself given his marching orders for a dangerous challenge on Keita after a VAR intervention.

    <h2 class = "subtitle">MAN OF THE MATCH - MOHAMED SALAH, LIVERPOOL</h2>
    <p>The Egyptian wizard struck gold with a magical three to silence Old Trafford.
A complete performance where he tormented Luke Shaw and Harry Maguire, exploiting every blade of grass between them in that dangerous right half-space he loves to work in with that left boot.
He was in the right place at the right time whenever he was needed, and he was instrumental in the build-up play to produce a complete, world-class performance.
There's nothing he can't do right now.</p>
    <h3>TALKING POINT - MAN UNITED MISERY, SALAH SUBLIME</h3>
    <p>
The home side were dismal, but take nothing away from Liverpool.
Klopp has masterminded an incredible strategy with an unbelievable side. They deserve everything they got today, and they were fabulous throughout.
The changes Klopp made pre-match were excellent, with Ibrahima Konate and Jota brilliant throughout.
But it was all about Salah, as he compounded United's woes, exploiting every defensive error made to seal a dream day for every Liverpudlian red.</p>
