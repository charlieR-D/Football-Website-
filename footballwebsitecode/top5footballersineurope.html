         <p class = text>One of the best players in the world, Neymar currently plays in the Ligue 1 for the club Paris Saint-Germain. Neymar is the second-highest goalscorer for the country, just behind Pelé with 64 goals in 103 matches.

Neymar’s 72nd goal put him in the list of top ten goal scorers in PSG history, his first goal against Angers.

He played an important for the victory in the 2011 South American Youth Championship and was the leading goalscorer. He has pocket many popular and prestigious awards.

He is the world’s fourth-most famous athlete and one of the most influential people in the world. He earns huge after transfer to PSG and ranks third among the highest-paid athletes.

        <h1 class = title>2) Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
         <p class = text>Yet another player we've run out of words to sing praises about, Cristiano Ronaldo, continues to silence his critics and detractors even at the age of 36. Having lost a yard of pace in recent times, Ronaldo took stock of the situation and evolved from a winger to a striker.

It is a decision that has worked out well for him. Ronaldo scored a total of 36 goals and provided four assists in 44 appearances across all competitions for Juventus in the 2020-21 season. He won the Serie A Golden Boot in the 2020-21 season and was also the recipient of the Euro 2020 Golden Boot with five goals from four games.
             
             Ronaldo has won five Ballons d'Or in his career and only Lionel Messi has won more, with six to his name. The Portuguese international is the perfect example of how hard work and determination pays off. He has always been willing to take on challenges. That's why he has won the league in three different countries.

        <h1 class = title>3) Lionel Messi</h1>
         <p class = text>This Argentine striker of Barcelona is often considered as one of the greatest players of all time. The lone player in history to possess five Ballon d’Ors. This 5’9″ is probably the finest dribblers of all time. His capacity of playmaking, quality of passing, finishing and scoring capacity is a joy to watch with a bowl of popcorns.

Considered to be one of the best football players in the world, he has failed to lead his team Argentina to claim the Copa America’16 title, but that can not mud his quality.

GOAT is now officially ex-Barcelona, and we have to wait to see where Messi will play the 2022-22 season, but no doubt that the football legend held the well-deserved title of best footballer for a decade.

        <h1 class = title>4) Robert Lewandowski</h1>
         <p class = text>Robert Lewandowski is arguably the best striker of his generation and has every right to feel robbed off the Ballon d'Or in 2020. The award was canceled last year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Bayern Munich striker was miles ahead of his competition last term.

He was Bayern Munich's lynchpin as they won the continental treble in the 2019-20 season. But Lewandowski put his Ballon d'Or disappointment behind him and kicked on in the same vein in the 2020-21 season.

He made just 27 appearances for Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga last term. But that proved to be enough for him to break Gerd Muller's record of 40 goals in a 38 match Bundesliga season. Lewandowski scored 41 goals in the German top flight in the 2020-21 season.

The 32-year-old scored 48 goals and provided nine assists in 40 appearances across all competitions for the Bavarians this past season. At Euro 2020, he scored three goals in three games for Poland but his exploits weren't enough to help them progress to the knockout stages.

        <h1 class = title>5) Kylian Mbappe</h1>
         <p class = text>Kylian Mbappe is just 22-years-old but it feels like he has been around breaking defenders' ankles and sending them for sandwiches for a very long time. He has been world-class since he first broke onto the scene as an exciting attacker for AS Monaco in the 2016-17 season.

His blistering pace, quick feet and composure in front of goal have rendered him a nightmare to go toe-to-toe against. In 2018, Mbappe played a starring role as France went on to become world champions.
             
             He has also been clocking incredible numbers for both club and country ever since. Although he had a largely forgettable Euro 2020, there is no questioning his ability and potential. In the 2020-21 season, Mbappe scored 42 goals and provided 12 assists in 47 appearances for Paris Saint-Germain across all competitions.
